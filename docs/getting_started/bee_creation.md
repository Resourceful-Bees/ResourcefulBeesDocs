## **Creating a Bee**
***

With the base mod alone you get 18 bees but you can add as many bees as you want and modify the existing bees.

* First access our config folder by going to your main config folder and then going into the folder called `resourcefulbees`.
* Then in our config folder you'll see a sub folder `bees`.
* You'll need to then go into the `bees`folder. 
* If you have run the game once you'll see 18 json files named according to each bee added in-game. 
* After you're in the `bees` folder you'll need to make a new json file with the name of the bee you want, so for example `Blaze.json` if you want to add a blaze bee. 
* After you've created the json file with the name of the bee you want to add, you'll need to open it. 
* After you open it, we're going to start to write the bee's file and include all the necessary lines that are required for the bee to get registered.
* You can see what configuration options are available by first going to the Custom Bee Data page on the left.
