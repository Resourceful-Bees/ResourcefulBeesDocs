### `useForgeBiomeDictionaries`

With a default mod installation, `useForgeBiomeDictionaries` is set to `true` in the `common.toml` config file. This means that you are stuck with whatever biome groupings forge has autogenerated.

The custom dictionary system does not auto-discover modded biomes and as such requires you to manually add them where necessary.
