## **Creating a Bee**
***

With the base mod alone you get 18 bees but you can add as many bees as you want and modify the existing bees.

* First locate the `resourcefulbees` config folder inside the main config folder.
* Inside this folder you'll see a sub folder labeled `bees`.
* If you have run the game at least once, you'll see 18 .json files named according to each bee added by the mod inside the `bees` folder. 
* Create a .json file inside this folder for each bee you wish to add to the game. So for example: `Blaze.json` if you want to add a blaze bee.
* After you've created a .json file with the name of the bee you want to add, you'll need to open it. 
* Using the [bee templ](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language)
* You can see what configuration options are available by first going to the Custom Bee Data page on the left.
