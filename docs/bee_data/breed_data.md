### **isBreedable** (Optional)

This value is used to determine if a bee can be bred from other bees. The value defaults to `false` and must be set to `true` if you want the bee to be breedable. Setting the value to `true` but not specifying the bees parents means the bee can only be bred by bees of the same type.
