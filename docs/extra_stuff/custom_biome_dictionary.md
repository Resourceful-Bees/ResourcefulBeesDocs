# **Custom Biome Dictionary**

## **Default Configuration**
***

With a default mod installation, `useForgeBiomeDictionaries` is set to `true` in the `common.toml` config file. This means that you are stuck with whatever biome groupings forge has autogenerated. This can be beneficial though, as it means that modded biomes are automatically discovered as long as they meet certain criteria. The downside is the inability to customize the groupings
